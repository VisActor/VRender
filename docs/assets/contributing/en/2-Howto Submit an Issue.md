# Submit the Issue

After filling out the issue form, click the "Submit new issue" button to submit your issue.

# Follow Up on the Issue

Once you have submitted the issue, you can check the status of your issue in the repository's "Issues" tab. The project developers may ask for more information or inform you that they are working on the issue.

# Close the Issue

If your problem has been resolved or your request has been fulfilled, the project developers will close the issue. You can also close the issue yourself if you believe the problem has been resolved or no longer need further assistance.

By following these steps, you can successfully raise an issue for an open-source project on GitHub. Remember to describe the issue in as much detail and clarity as possible, as this will help the project developers understand and address your problem more quickly.
