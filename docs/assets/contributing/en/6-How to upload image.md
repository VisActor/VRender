# How to Upload Images
Images are often used in tutorial documents to provide visual explanations.
We recommend using a stable image hosting service to upload images. Here, we introduce the solution of using cdn.jsdelivr.net as an image hosting service.

## 6.1 Upload Images
First, create a folder in your personal GitHub repository to store the images used in the document.
For example, the directory https://github.com/xuanhun/articles/tree/main/visactor/img contains a large number of images. Taking the image A3gybJqQLo7vH8xV8I3cA7NknRc.gif as an example, the corresponding GitHub URL is:
https://github.com/xuanhun/articles/blob/main/visactor/img/A3gybJqQLo7vH8xV8I3cA7NknRc.gif.

In the specific markdown document, we convert it to the cdn.jsdelivr.net URL:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/[username]/[repo name]/[image path]

![Example Image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/xuanhun/articles/visactor/img/A3gybJqQLo7vH8xV8I3cA7NknRc.gif)
